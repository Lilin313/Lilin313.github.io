        <h1>Honeywell, I' m Home</h1>
   
    <div class="content">
        <p>In 1972, as part of MoMA’s exhibition “Italy: The New Domestic Landscape,” the Radical Design group Superstudio installed a small cubic room with mirrored walls that appeared to replicate itself into infinity.
            The group’s proposal, submitted to the curator Emilio Ambasz, had taken the form of a one-page statement describing exactly how this “microenvironment” should be installed, followed by a further nine typed pages of theoretical exposition
            by Superstudio’s cofounder Adolfo Natalini. In those nine pages—a manifesto of sorts, veering off into prose poems and short stories—Natalini outlines a new way of living. The attributes of this hypothetical
            existence include “permanent nomadism,” “life without objects,” and “life without work.” These conditions are made possible by a mysterious gridded structure that Natalini refers to only as
        </p>

        <div class="box">
            “the network.”
        </div>


    </div>
   
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            It is only too easy to root around in the archives,extract something highly selective, and proclaim this or that radical to have been prophetic. 
            In this case, however, Natalini’s vision appears uncannily prescient. Of course, “the network” of his imagination was simply an act of wish 
            fulfillment—he hadn’t the slightest idea what it was exactly (although, by coincidence, 1972 was also the year that ARPANET was first demonstrated in public), 
            he knew only that it was a “total system of communication.” In Superstudio’s photo-collages,it took the form of a grid—either an abstract gridded
            plane or a gridded megastructure called The Continuous Monument. Theirs was only a mock utopia, serving to critique both modernism and consumerism, and yet, ineluctably, 
            the network came to pass.

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                It is not, however, a megastructure.

            In fact, for all intents and purposes—for the majority who cannot see the server farms and the undersea cables—it is invisible.

        The effects of the network age on urban life in the early twenty-first century are roughly as Natalini predicted, if less utopian. Immaterial labor has led 
        to a flexible but precarious existence in which, for the young at least, “permanent nomadism” is not so far from the truth. Objects, meanwhile, are dematerializing into

        We need look no further than the rise and rise of Airbnb. The rental website epitomizes a new era of nomadic, vicarious living, in which one can simply slip into different 
        lifestyles like dresses. Its evangelists proclaim a utopian mission of sharing over owning (CEO Brian Chesky famously claims not to own a home),
        and like good neo-Marxists they talk of use-value rather than exchange-value. But of course Airbnb enables a global population to be part of the rentier class. 
        It is as much a symptom of precarity as of networked livng—it is the means by which many now pay their own rents and mortgages. Airbnb is what we have instead of state-subsidized affordable housing, 
        and it is leading to the wholesale commodification of domestic space.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the first time since the mid-twentieth century—with its labor-saving household appliances and rising quality of life—the domestic is once again the site of radical change. And though 
        domestic space appears to fall within the realm of architecture, architects themselves have been almost
    </p>

    <div>
        <p class="sixth-paragraph">
            mute on the implications of such change
        </p>
        
    </div>

    <p>
        Architecture, it seems, has given up its dreams of imagining how we might live, and so into that void technology is rushing. That tired old trope of “the 
        house of the future” has been replaced by what is now called the “smart home.” The smart home is the network’s great white hope for ubiquitous connectivity. 
        It sounds benign enough, and may conjure Jacques Tati-style mise-en-scènes populated by absurd devices—the smart home is prime territory for farce—but it is also an ideology. 
        It is the house-shaped manifestation of the internet of things, according to which all our devices and appliances will join the network, communicating with us and each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        To say that the internet of things is an ideology is to suggest that the use-value of the concept has yet to be sold to the consumer. It is easily mocked 
        by skeptical hacks who question the need for talking fridges and washing machines that you can program with your smartphone (“You still need to put the clothes in yourself, right?”). Bruce Sterling 
        argues that the internet of things has nothing to do with the consumer and everything to do with the business interests of the service providers. 
        Given that data is the new currency, the internet of things is an epic power grab by the lords of the network—Sterling focuses on the “big five” of

        </p>
        
    </div>

    <p>
        to gain control of as much human data as physically possible.As the primary interface of the internet of things, 
        the smart home is effectively the tendrils of the network rising out of the ground and into every one of our household appliances to allow 
        mass data collection and digital surveillance.
    </p>

    <p>
        That, at least, is one interpretation. It goes without saying that

    <div>
        <p class="eighth-paragraph">
            "The internet of things agenda is being driven by the technology industry 
            with the eager boosterism of the business community, which sees a blizzard of dollar signs"
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        And while the evangelists of the IoT would hardly define themselves in Sterling’s terms, neither do they contradict him. As an effusive cover story in the 
        Harvard Business Review put it recently, “It is the expanded capabilities of smart, connected products and the data they generate that are ushering in a 
        new era of competition.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The question is, what are the implications for architecture? Do these developments have spatial ramifications? 
        Should we plan and build in new ways to accommodate this technological surge, or is it just a case of running a few extra wires into the walls? 
        Can architects continue to design according to age-old principles of good form and sound proportions (or stick to the boilerplate floor plans 
        prescribed by greedy developers, as the case may be)?
    </p>

    <p>
        The history of architectural historians overlooking the impact of technological innovations is a long one, and its best chronicler was Reyner 
        Banham. In The Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment, he charts the effects of successive environmental revolutions,

        and air-conditioning, on built form. Banham’s geeky enthusiasm for ducting and electrical services enables him to propose a parallel history of 
        architecture according to which the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast (1903), despite its outmoded, castellated styling, was “far more pioneering than 
        anything that had been designed by Walter Gropius” because it was
